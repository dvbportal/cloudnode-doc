Cloudnode Developer Shell
=========================

The Developer Shell provides you with command-line access using computing
resources hosted on the Cloudnode platform. It makes it easy for you to 
manage your projects from your browser without the  need to install the
`Cloudnode Command Line </cloudnode-command-line>`_ and other tools locally
on your system. All tools are always available when you need them.

Developer Shell features:

- A ephemeral compute engine instance running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Command-line access to the instance from your web browser using a terminal window
- About 5 GB persistant disk storage mounted as your $HOME directory
- Cloudnode Command Line and other tools (node, git, docker, ...) preinstalled and ready to use
- Read-only access to all your managed apps running on the platform

You can also use the Developer Shell to perform tasks which would normally require a Linux
machine even if you are running a PC or another device.

.. note:: **Beta** This is a Beta feature that is not covered by a SLA and may be subject to changes.
